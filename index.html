  <p>Earth—our home planet—is the only place we know of so far that’s inhabited by living things. It's also the only
    planet in our solar system with liquid water on the surface.</p>

  <p>Our home planet is the third planet from the Sun, and the only place we know of so far that’s inhabited by living
    things. While Earth is only the fifth largest planet in the solar system, it is the only world in our solar system
    with liquid water on the surface. Just slightly larger than nearby Venus, Earth is the biggest of the four planets
    closest to the Sun, all of which are made of rock and metal.

  <h3>Continents on the Earth</h3>

  <p>Africa, the Americas, Antarctica, Asia, Australia, together with Oceania, and Europe are considered to be
    continents.<br>
    The word continent is used to differentiate between various large land areas of Earth into which all the land
    surface of the planet is divided. The term refers to the 'mountain top' regions of the Earth not <i>flooded</i> by
    water, dry land.
    The level of the surrounding water ultimately defines the shape and borders of continents. More water implies less
    land and different outlines. Even more water, like that stored away as ice in the poles and glaciers, and you might
    live on a water planet, no continents

  <p>The Earth’s surface is made up of more than 70 per cent water, which is vital to all organisms on the planet.<br>
    The world’s biggest water bodies, the oceans, are a mark of international pride and are sometimes also called
    Earth’s lifelines, since they provide sea-lanes for international trade, apart from providing products like seafood
    as well as marine life itself for aquariums, pets
